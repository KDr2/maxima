Maxima is a symbolic computation program.  It is full featured,
doing symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices, rational
functions, integration, Todd-coxeter, graphing, bigfloats.  It has a
symbolic debugger source level debugger for maxima code.  Maxima is
based on the original Macsyma developed at MIT in the 1970's.
It comes with more than 10000 self test steps.

Maxima is distributed under the GNU General Public License, with some
export restrictions from the U.S. Department of Energy. See the file
COPYING.

Installation information is available in the file INSTALL. Summary
information about this release can be found in the file NEWS. Detailed
change information is available in the ChangeLog.

A simple usage example:

(%i1)	pyth:a^2+b^2=c^2$

(%i2)	solve(pyth,a);sol1:%[2];
(%o2)	[a=-sqrt(c^2-b^2),a=sqrt(c^2-b^2)]
(%o3)	a=sqrt(c^2-b^2)

(%i4)	integrate(sol1,b);
(%o4)	a*b=(c^2*asin(b/abs(c)))/2+(b*sqrt(c^2-b^2))/2+%c1

(%i5)	val:[c=15,b=10];
(%o5)	[c=15,b=10]

(%i6)	subst(val,sol1);
(%o6)	a=5^(3/2)
