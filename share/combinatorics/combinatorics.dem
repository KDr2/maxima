"This gives the 24 permutations of order 4, in lexicographic order:"$
permutations_lex (4);

"Let's get the permutation of order 8 given by the cycles [1,4] and
       [2,6,5,7]:"$

p1: permutation_undecomp ([[1,4], [2,6,5,7]], 8);

"The inverse operation, representing the permutation by cycles, is:"$

permutation_cycles (p1);

"Any permutation can also be decomposed into a product of adjacent
      transpositions (cycles with only two consecutive integers). The
      index of a permutation is the minimum number of such transpositions:"$

"Let's find that product of 12 transpositions and save it in t1."$

"Suppose we have a list with 8 elements:"$

"We can apply a permutation of order 8 to it:"$

lis2: apply_permutation (p1, lis1);

"A list of cycles can also be applied to the list. In the case of t1
      above the inverse of the permutation is obtained just by inverting
      the order of the transpositions. Therefore, if we apply t1 in
      reverse order, to the list obtained in the previous command, the
      result will give back the original list:"$

p3: permult (p1, p2);

"The product of any permutation times its inverse gives the identity:"$

permult (p3, invert_permutation (p3));

"The rank of a permutation is the order in which it appears in the
      lexicographic sequence:"$

map (permutation_lex_rank, [p1, p2, p3]);

"The parity of a permutation, given in this package by 0 or 1, tells
      whether the index of a permutation is even or odd. The product of
      an even permutation by an odd one gives another odd permutation:"$
