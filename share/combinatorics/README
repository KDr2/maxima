Robert Dodier, February 2006:
-----------------------------
There were two files here which implemented two versions of a
permutation function, both of which are superseded by the permutation
function in maxima/src/nset.lisp.

Jaime Villate, November 2017:
-----------------------------
I have added a package that implements some of the permutations
functions of Macsyma and will implement many other functions.

Some differences with Macsyma: permutation_decomp has been named here
permutation_cycles and permutation_decomp is used for decomposition
into the generators of the permutation group (adjacent transpositions).
permutation_cycles returns only non-trivial cycles; i.e, [[1,4,5],[3,6]]
instead of [[1,4,5],[2],[3,6]].

permutation_undecomp does not require a complete set of cycles, such
as [[1,4,5],[2],[3,6],[7]]; it accepts just [[1,4,5],[3,6]], but it
needs an extra parameter, namely, the order of the group. For example:
     permutation_undecomp([[1,4,5],[3,6]],7)

permutations_lex returns the list of permutations of order n, in
lexicographic order, but unlike Macsyma's version, the argument should
be just an integer (n) and not a permutation.

Notice that the functions permutations and random_permutation from
from package nset give different orderings of a set of objects, but
not permutations the way they are understood here: namely, a list of
the first n positive integers without repetitions.
