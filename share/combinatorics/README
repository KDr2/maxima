Robert Dodier, February 2006:
-----------------------------
There were two files here which implemented two versions of a
permutation function, both of which are superseded by the permutation
function in maxima/src/nset.lisp.

Jaime Villate, November 2017:
-----------------------------
I have added a package that implements some of the permutations
functions of Macsyma and will implement many other functions.

Some differences with Macsyma: permutation_decomp has been named here
permutation_cycles (permutation_decomp will be used for decomposition
into the generators of the permutation group) and it returns only
non-trivial cycles; i.e, [[1,4,5],[3,6]] instead of [[1,4,5],[2],[3,6]].

permutation_undecomp does not require a complete set of cycles, such
as [[1,4,5],[2],[3,6],[7]]; it accepts just [[1,4,5],[3,6]], but it
needs an extra parameter, namely, the order of the group. For example:
     permutation_undecomp([[1,4,5],[3,6]],7)


Unlike Macsyma, the permutations() function from nset.lisp gives the list
of permutations as a set and in lexicographic order. It also accepts lists
with repeated elements, given distinct permutations in its output. The
result can be turned into a list with the listify() function.
